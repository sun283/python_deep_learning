# Longest Collatz sequence
# Problem 14
# The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:

# n → n/2 (n is even)
# n → 3n + 1 (n is odd)

# Using the rule above and starting with 13, we generate the following sequence:

# 13 → 40 → 20 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1
# It can be seen that this sequence (starting at 13 and finishing at 1) contains 10 terms. 
# Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem), it is thought that all starting numbers finish at 1.

# Which starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain?

# NOTE: Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to go above one million.
